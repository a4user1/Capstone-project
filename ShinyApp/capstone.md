Summary
========================================================
* The aim of this report is to highlight a predictive algorithm, previously developed in a [Milestone Report](http://rpubs.com/cbarco/DSCapstone_Milestone_Report) and to provide a user interface that can be easily accessed using mobile web browsers.

Description of the Web application
========================================================
* The essence of this project is to take a corpus of text and build a predictive tool to present a user with a prediction of the next likely word based on their input.

Instructions
========================================================
* In order to use, and obtain a direct answer to your query, under the "Please enter your text below" title, the User types phrase/words in a input form.
* After a couple of seconds, the web application shows the word that best fits their query.

We would like to hear from you!
========================================================
* At the moment, we are carrying out a great effort in order to hire personel to develop a more deeper exploratory data analysis, using greater and more complex data sets.
ThatÂ´s why we take the strategic decision to show you this prototype, in order to freely probe and give us feedback, to get the opinion of the user and reduce our learning curve.
